# mandelbrot-visualizer 🔬
A simple mandelbrot visualization program.

This program was designed primarily as a thought exercise into precisions and SFML. I would have loved to have added a Quad-tree and multithreading, but that'll have to wait for another day.

## Controls 🕹
- O: Reset the view
- Left Click: zoom at specified location
- Scroll: increase/decrease max. iterations

## Giving Thanks 🍗
I never would have been able to do anything like this without the amazing library made by the brainiacs behind [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)!
